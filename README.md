# Infosec: resources for information security

This repo contains resources and links related to information security (infosec) for journalists. They are designed for students on the [MA in Data Journalism](http://www.bcu.ac.uk/media/courses/data-journalism-ma-2018-19) and the [MA in Multiplatform and Mobile Journalism](http://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/multiplatform-and-mobile-journalism-ma-2018-19) at Birmingham City University, but should be useful for anyone interested in protecting their sources, stories and reputations.

## Threat modeling

Any infosec approach should start by modeling the threat you are likely to face.
